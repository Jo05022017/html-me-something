            <p>My name is Johanna Kovac. I was born in Venezuela, South America. I grew up in Barquisimeto, Lara State. I am the oldest kid, with a sister and two brothers. One of the thing than I am really enjoy is listening music and traveling.</p>
            <p>Living outside of my country and adopting new culture makes me feel more open to understand and accept others. I am appreciate what I learned and makes me appreciatte what I have.</p>
            <p> Barquisimeto and St. Louis represents my life. </p>

            <h2>Barquisimeto</h2><br>

            <p>Barquisimeto is a city in Venezuela. It is the capital of the state of Lara and head of Iribarren Municipality.</p>
            <p>Barquisimeto, the capital of Lara state, in central western Venezuela, is the 4th most populated and most important Venezuelan city (more than 800,000 inhabitants). It is one of my top favorite Venezuelan cities, because is very clean and organized, and is IMO the best planned Venezuelan city (even better planned than Guayana City, in Bolivar state). I also like it, because it has a good standard of living, and have nothing to envy on its level of infrastructure, services, and entertainment, compared to the three major Venezuelan cities of Caracas, Maracaibo and Valencia. Additionally, it enjoys a relatively temperate climate, since it is located at more than 600 mts (2,040 feet) over the sea level.</p>
            <p>Barquisimeto is located on a high plateau that is right on the exact location where the Venezuelan Andes begins its long journey towards the Southwest, change its name to Cordillera Oriental (eastern range) in Colombia, and continues its long journey down south, down to the Patagonia, in southernmost South America.</p>
            <p>Barquisimeto was founded in 1552 by the Spaniard Juan de Villegas, and its original name was Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto.</p>
            <p>The mode of transportation most commonly used are the <q>rapiditos</q>, old automobiles with an average capacity of 5 passengers, with a route similar to the buses and used mainly to shuttle people between downtown and the suburbs, like the shared cabs in other countries.</p>

            <h2>St. Louis</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/St_Louis_night_expblend.jpg"><br>
            <p>St. Louis, the second-largest city in Missouri, is located in the east central part of the state on the Mississippi River. The city is independent and is not part of any county.</p>
            <p>St. Louis was founded by the French in 1764 when Auguste Chouteau established a fur-trading post and Pierre Lacl√®de Liguest, a New Orleans merchant, founded a town at the present site. They named it after King Louis XV of France and his patron saint, Louis IX. From 1770 to 1803, St. Louis was a Spanish possession, but it was ceded back to France in 1803 in accordance with the Treaty of San Ildefonso (1800), only to be acquired by the U.S. as part of the Louisiana purchase later that year.</p>
            <p>Manufacturing is important to the city's economy, and its highly developed industries include automobiles, aircraft and space technology, metal fabrication, beer, steelmaking, chemicals, food processing, and storage and distribution.</p>
            <p>The giant stainless steel Gateway Arch, 630 ft high, standing on the banks of the Mississippi, symbolizes St. Louis as the Gateway to the West.</p>
